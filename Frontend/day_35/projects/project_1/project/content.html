                        <p id="content_2">Goal Oriented Academy has Design Course and Coding Course. In Coding you learn: html, css, python and etc. but in Design Course, you learn Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and more. If you learn at least one of them, it is good and if you learn both, then you know anything about coding and editing videos perfectly. It costs about 280â‚¾ every 8 lessons but its worth it, because other academies are little more expensive and I guarantee the experience of studying is not good, unlike Goal Oriented Academy. There's Kahoot challenges, Python Programs, Web Development, Frontend Development in learning experience of Coding.</p>
