            <p>Every Web you see is made from HTML (or HyperText Markup Language). You can add Cascading Style Sheet (or CSS) and JavaScript (or JS). HTML makes Web Structure, CSS makes style to web and JS makes interactivity. (learn connecting CSS to HTML in "Introduction to CSS" course). </p>

            <p>HTML codes are called Tags. First, to make sites, you need to learn HTML Structure. You need &lt;html&gt; Tag to start making Web, then you need &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags, (head stores web info and body stores scripts). This is simply called Nesting. the &lt;title&gt; tag allows you to name the tab its name (recommended on head tag).</p>
