            <p>Have you ever wondered how beautiful are some sites, well they use CSS. to link css to html, use this code: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css source file". this is called External CSS. there's two other ways, but this method is the most professional. the color: [color] property makes color to text and the background: [color] makes background color to text. the text-align: [align] is the same as align="" but on CSS.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="box2OfCourse4">

            <p>The font-weight: [value] makes text bold and the text-decoration: [value] makes text underline. the font-style: [value] makes text italic. the text-shadow: [value] makes text with shadow. In CSS, making elements with class or id is important. the font-family: [value] displays font type. the width: [value] makes widthness of div or form etc. and height: [value] makes height of div or form etc.</p>
