                    <p class="footer">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a <br> transition and have heard some people who had am amazing experience here. I signed up for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                    <p class="footer1">"Before joining the bootcamp. I've <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br> dissapoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial could ever have. In <br> fact, I've often reffered to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> development experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer and after receiving multiple <br> offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
